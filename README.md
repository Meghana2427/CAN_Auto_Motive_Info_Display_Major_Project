# CAN_Auto_Motive_Info_Display_Major_Project
This project implements a CAN-based automotive information display system using the LPC2129 microcontroller. It monitors and displays real-time vehicle parameters such as engine temperature, fuel level, and indicator status using CAN communication between multiple nodes. The system is developed using Embedded C and tested using Keil and Flash Magic
